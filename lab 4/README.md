# Working with Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries
Lab overview
In Python, string and numeric data types are often used in groups called collections. Three such collections that Python supports are the list, the tuple, and the dictionary.

In this lab, you will:

Use the list data type
Use the tuple data type
Use the dictionary data type___
Estimated completion time
45 minutes

Exercise 1: Introducing the list data type
Accessing the AWS Cloud9 IDE
Start your lab environment by going to the top of these instructions and choosing Start Lab.

A Start Lab panel opens, displaying the lab status.

Wait until you see the message Lab status: ready, and then close the Start Lab panel by choosing the X.

At the top of these instructions, choose AWS.

The AWS Management Console opens in a new browser tab. The system automatically logs you in.

Note: If a new browser tab does not open, a banner or icon at the top of your browser typically indicates that your browser is preventing the site from opening pop-up windows. Choose the banner or icon, and choose Allow pop ups.

In the AWS Management Console, choose Services > Cloud9. In the Your environments panel, locate the reStart-python-cloud9 card, and choose Open IDE.

The AWS Cloud9 environment opens.

Note: If a pop-up window opens with the message .c9/project.settings have been changed on disk, choose Discard to ignore it. Likewise, if a dialog window prompts you to Show third-party content, choose No to decline.

Creating your Python exercise file
From the menu bar, choose File > New From Template > Python File.

This action creates an untitled file.

Delete the sample code provided from the template file.

Choose File > Save As..., and provide a suitable name for the exercise file (for example, collections.py and save it under the /home/ec2-user/environment directory.

Accessing the terminal session
In your AWS Cloud9 IDE, choose the + icon and select New Terminal.

A terminal session opens.

To display the present working directory, enter pwd. This command points to /home/ec2-user/environment.

In this directory, you should also be able to locate the file you created in the previous section.

Defining a list
In this activity, you will edit a Python script to hold a collection of fruit names, or a list of fruit.

From the navigation pane of the IDE, choose the .py file that you created in the previous Creating your Python exercise file section.

In the file, enter the following code:

myFruitList = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(myFruitList)
print(type(myFruitList))
Save and run the file.

Confirm that the script runs correctly and that the output displays as you expect it to.

Accessing a list by position
You can access the contents of a list by position. In this activity, you will print out each item in our list by their position:

In programming languages, the list position starts at zero (0). The brackets tell Python which position in the list you want. To access the apple string, enter the following code:

print(myFruitList[0])
To access the banana string, enter the following:

print(myFruitList[1])
To access the cherry string, enter the following code:

print(myFruitList[2])
Save and run the file.

Confirm that the script runs correctly and that the output displays as you expect it to.

Changing the values in a list
The values of a list can be changed. In this activity, you will change cherry to orange.

In Python, list position starts at zero (0), so you must use the numeral 2 to access the third position. Enter the following code:

myFruitList[2] = "orange"
Print the updated list:

print(myFruitList)
Save and run the file.

Confirm that the script runs correctly and that the output displays as you expect it to.

['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']                                
<class 'list'>                                               
apple                                                        
banana                                                       
cherry                                                       
['apple', 'banana', 'orange'] 
Exercise 2: Introducing the tuple data type
Defining a tuple
The tuple is like a list, but it can't be changed. A data type that can't be changed after it's created is said to be immutable. To define a tuple, you use parentheses instead of brackets ([]).

Create a tuple by entering the following code:

myFinalAnswerTuple = ("apple", "banana", "pineapple")
print(myFinalAnswerTuple)
print(type(myFinalAnswerTuple))
Save and run the file.

Confirm that the script runs correctly and that the output displays as you expect it to.

Accessing a tuple by position
Like a list, the items of a tuple can also be accessed by position:

To access the apple string, enter the following code:

print(myFinalAnswerTuple[0])
To access the banana string, enter the following code:

print(myFinalAnswerTuple[1])
To access the pineapple string, enter the following code:

print(myFinalAnswerTuple[2])
Save and run the file.

Near the top of the IDE window, choose the Run (Play) button.

Confirm that the script runs correctly and that the output displays as you expect it to.

['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']                                
<class 'list'>                                               
apple                                                        
banana                                                       
cherry                                                       
['apple', 'banana', 'orange']                                
('apple', 'banana', 'pineapple')                             
<class 'tuple'>                                              
apple                                                        
banana                                                       
pineapple
Exercise 3: Introducing the dictionary data type
Defining a dictionary
A dictionary is a list with named positions (keys). Imagine that your list shows peopleâ€™s favorite fruit.

Return to the Python script, and enter the following code:

myFavoriteFruitDictionary = {
  "Akua" : "apple",
  "Saanvi" : "banana",
  "Paulo" : "pineapple"
}
Use the print() function to write the dictionary to the shell:

print(myFavoriteFruitDictionary)
Use the type() function to write the data type to the shell:

print(type(myFavoriteFruitDictionary))
Save and run the file.

Confirm that the script runs correctly and that the output displays as you expect it to.

Accessing a dictionary by name
In this activity, you will use the name of the individuals to get their favorite fruit, instead of numbers.

To access Akua's favorite fruit, enter the following code:

print(myFavoriteFruitDictionary["Akua"])
To access Saanvi's favorite fruit, enter the following code:

print(myFavoriteFruitDictionary["Saanvi"])
To access Paulo's favorite fruit, enter the following code:

print(myFavoriteFruitDictionary["Paulo"])
Save and run the file.

Confirm that the script runs correctly and that the output displays as you expect it to.

['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']                                
<class 'list'>                                               
apple                                                        
banana                                                       
cherry                                                       
['apple', 'banana', 'orange']                                
('apple', 'banana', 'pineapple')                             
<class 'tuple'>                                              
apple                                                        
banana                                                       
pineapple                                                    
{'Akua': 'apple', 'Saanvi': 'banana', 'Paulo': 'pineapple'}     
<class 'dict'>                                               
apple                                                        
banana                                                       
pineapple                                                   
Congratulations! You have worked with the list, tuple, and dictionary data types in Python.
